# Junior Jellies

Over the years, our team has flourished by organizing and facilitating Junior Jellies, a student-centered and self-run afterschool program focused on STEM, specifically introducing elementary school students to FIRST. Our primary objective is to instill FIRST principles, such as Gracious Professionalism and Coopetition, which promote friendly competition and positive collaboration, within Blind Brook students. We aspire to equip these students with the necessary skills to become successful, both as potential Jellyfish members and as lifelong learners. Our ultimate goal is to expand our impact within the community by inspiring the next generation to take an active interest in STEM.

## Junior Jellies Engineering

Junior Jellies Engineering is a flagship program of our team that has been developed based on feedback and experience gained through our other Junior Jellies initiatives. This six-week program is designed to introduce 4th and 5th grade students to the engineering opportunities available at the district's middle and high schools. Every week, a new project is introduced, providing students with a hands-on demonstration of a new engineering concept, such as basic physics or electrical engineering. We also use TinkerCAD to teach students about computer-aided design.

Our team places a great emphasis on our adaptability, which extends to our approach to Junior Jellies. We consistently modify our curriculum based on student feedback to ensure that our program offers the best possible learning experience. Furthermore, we strive to instill healthy competition within our students, as we believe it is crucial for them to learn the principles of Gracious Professionalism. By promoting kindness, enthusiasm, and respect, even in the face of challenging circumstances, we aim to cultivate a positive learning environment where students can thrive.

We maintain a 2:1 student/teacher ratio, with each instructor matched with two Junior Jellies. This approach fosters cooperation and provides focused attention to each student. Our greatest source of pride is the community that we have built through this program. We strive to ignite a passion for engineering among our students, and the acceptance and creativity they develop are the most rewarding and valuable aspects of our team endeavor. Many of our current Jellyfish members were first introduced to robotics as Junior Jellies participants, and they are now continuing the cycle as instructors for the next generation of young engineers. Additionally, Junior Jellies Engineering has become our largest source of income.

## Junior Jellies Java

Junior Jellies Java is an exciting program that builds on the success of the Blind Brook Robotics club’s Junior Jellies program in partnership with the Computer Club. Our program is designed to teach middle school students about basic fundamental concepts of Java, and it is facilitated by highly motivated and talented high school students who are passionate about computer science.

Given that our district currently lacks any computer science courses for middle school students, we recognized an opportunity to fill this critical gap in the curriculum. Through Junior Jellies Java, we aim to fill this void and inspire students to pursue computer science and STEM fields in the future. We strongly believe that by introducing these basic concepts at a young age, we can spark a lifelong interest and passion for computer science in young minds. Moreover, Junior Jellies Java also functions as a crucial source of fundraising for our robotics team. By providing high-quality instruction in a fun and engaging way, we hope to attract a wide range of students who will not only benefit from the program but also help support our team’s activities.

Overall, Junior Jellies Java is an excellent opportunity for middle school students to learn about programming and for high school students to share their passion for computer science. We are extremely proud to offer this program and excited to see the impact it has on our STEM community.

## Legacy Junior Jellies Programs

- **Junior Jellies Robotics**

Junior Jellies Robotics was our team’s first Junior Jellies program. The curriculum was modeled after  [FLL (FIRST LEGO League)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll) using LEGO Robotics, offering a challenge similar to those issued in FLL and allowing Junior Jellies to work on their robot over the course of seven weeks. On the final day of the program, students competed with their robots, vying for awards in various categories that closely mirrored those of FLL competitions.

Junior Jellies Robotics provided an excellent opportunity for students to develop their knowledge of basic robotics concepts, while also learning essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork. The program also emphasized the importance of forming alliances with other teams, with students working as allies in one match and as opponents in another.

In addition to promoting STEM education, Junior Jellies Robotics served as a means for our team to connect with younger students in our community, fostering a passion for STEM and encouraging students to explore their interests in related fields. Overall, we are proud to have launched our first Junior Jellies program with such great success, and we remain committed to offering programs that inspire the next generation of STEM leaders.

- **Junior Jellies Python**

During the 2020-21 school year with the pandemic, we created the Junior Jellies Python program to teach middle school students basic fundalmentals about Python. This was an ideal  way to virtually connect with our community and fundraise for the team. The highlight of both programs is their staggered curriculum developed to scaffold and accommodate students with varied coding experience. This program has been replaced by Junior Jellies Java. By introducing Java to the district’s students before they enter high school, we hope to garner more interest in programming for the robotics team. In the past, we have struggled with finding programmers as team members had little to no experience coding  due to a lack of experience and exposure.
